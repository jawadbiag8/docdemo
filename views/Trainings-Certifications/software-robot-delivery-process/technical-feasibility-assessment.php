<h2>Things to keep in mind while conducting technical feasibility of process</h2>

<p>The technical feasibility assessment is done to understand if the automation goal is realistic. It is good to find any technical showstoppers early on. In the spirit of agile development, <strong>fail fast</strong> (and save money
    doing so)!</p>

<p>Think of the following questions to figure out if the process could be technically feasible to automate:
</p>
<h4 id="could-a-robot-complete-the-process-by-following-unambiguous-rules">Rules within the process</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the business rules are easy to follow, unambiguous, and do not require human judgment, great!
    </li>
    <li>
        If the rules are complex but unambiguous, more effort is necessary during the implementation, but the automation could still be doable.
    </li>
    <li>
        If human judgment is required to complete the process, it might be difficult or costly to automate the process. In those cases, you could think if <em>parts</em> of the process could still be automated.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="can-a-robot-easily-read-the-data-required-by-the-process">Data required by process</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the input data required by the process is in a digitized format that the robot can read comfortably, wonderful!

    </li>
    <li>
        If the data requires some transformation before the robot can use it, things get more complicated. Still a good chance for success!
    </li>
    <li>
        If the data needs to be extracted from images, PDF documents, or emails, there are solutions for those, but prepare for a bit more intensive implementation. No blockers, still (unless the budget is exceeded)!

    </li>
    <li>
        If the data is not in a digitized format (it&#x27;s on paper, for example), you need to get that data digitized. Depending on your budget, this might be a showstopper.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="can-a-robot-operate-all-the-required-software">Types of Applications</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>If there are only web applications involved, this is usually the best case (plenty of support for automation).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If the process involves desktop applications or even old fashioned mainframes, the implementation might take more effort (depending on the operating system and the applications).</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="can-the-robot-access-all-the-required-accounts">Systems/Accounts Access</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the robot can use its own credentials on all systems to complete the process, great!
    </li>
    <li>
        If the authentication can not be automated completely, some human intervention is likely to be needed. This will have an impact on development.
    </li>
</ul>
