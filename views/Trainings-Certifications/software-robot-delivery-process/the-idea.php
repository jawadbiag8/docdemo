                        <p>This activity is conducted by Business Analyst. The purpose of this activity is to gain a clearer picture of what business activities are ideal for automation through Autosphere. There are many factors on the basis of which BA can
                            determine if the business process is a candidate for RPA. </p>
                        <h4 id="time-to-automate">Employee Involvement on Time consuming and Manual tasks </h4>
                        <p>Many operational processes are suitable for automation if they are time: Time-consuming; variates in transactional demand and most importantly highly dependent on employee involvement. Example of such activities order and claims processing,
                            propagating customer information to database etc. </p>
                        <h4 id="Complexity">Complexity</h4>
                        <p>Autosphere is capable of automating processes that are rule based, processes that require complex decision making are not suitable for automation.</p>
                        <p>Complexity of a processes can be defined by considering multiple factors such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Number of applications/systems </li>
                            <li>Number of steps </li>
                            <li>Structured on un structured data </li>
                            <li>Percentage of free text </li>
                            <li>Complex applications such as SAP </li>
                            <li>OCR based Handwritten text </li>
                            <li>Percentage of exceptions for a specific process. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 id="Volume">Volume</h4>
                        <p>Autosphere digital workforce is most efficient and productive tool to address high volume tasks because software robots are able to work.24/7 with much faster pace as compared to humans. </p>

                        <P>As robots work exactly the way they are programmed, they donâ€™t make mistakes on recurring defined tasks as compared to humans. </P>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                What are most of the people in the organization working on? More people -&gt; more work -&gt; more tasks to automate.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ideas for automation can come from the person completing the process or someone else involved in the process.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You might have an idea for a process that would improve efficiency, but can not be completed even manually at the moment. Sometimes automation enables you to start creating completely new processes instead of just automating existing ones.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Collect all the possible automation ideas in a backlog. Then decide which process it makes sense to start with: depending on your use case, it could be the easiest process to automate, or the one that you think will have the biggest return of investment.
                                Do not just pick the first one that you find: having good first experiences is important, both for people and for organizations!
