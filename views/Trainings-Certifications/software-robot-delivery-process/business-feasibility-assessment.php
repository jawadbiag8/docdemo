    <p>Ok, after the technical feasibility assessment, we know that the process could be automated. But just because something is technically doable, it does not necessarily make business sense to do it!</p>
    <p>When evaluating the feasibility of a Robotic Process Automation project, you should include a business feasibility assessment phase, to understand if the automation would lead to a positive return on investment or not.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself these questions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The more often the process needs to be completed manually, the better the potential benefits of automating it. Faster completion, fewer errors, time to focus on more exciting things!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If the process is manual and time-consuming but does not happen often, you need to consider the cost of implementing the automation. Does the effort pay itself back (positive ROI)?</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Do you anticipate that the process will stay mostly the same for some time? Substantial changes in the process will require more development work to adapt the robot to new requirements, so if you expect the process to change often,
            it might be reason enough to decide not to automate it.</li>

    <p>After going through the all of the processes RPA Business Analyst selects the processes suitable for automation and builds automation roadmap based on prioritization matrix.</p>
    <p>Prioritization matrix helps to prioritize the automation journey and deliver most value with minimal effort in shortest time, hence quickly impacts an organization in realizing the potential of Autosphere. </p>
    <p>Points to be considered in Prioritization Matrix: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start automating the “Low hanging fruits” Processes that present a combination of High potential and low Complexity”.</li>
        <li>High Potential is driven by volume and time reduction.</li>
        <li>Complexity is driven by characteristics such as presence of structured data number of rules or steps etc.</li>
    </ul>
