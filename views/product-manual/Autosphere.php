                    <h4 id="learn">Learn</h4>
                    <p>To <em>learn</em> the art of building and running software robots, you have <strong>documentation</strong>. The documentation includes resources for all-the-things
                        related to software robot development.</p>
                    <h4 id="build">Build</h4>
                    <p>To <em>build</em> software robots, you have Autosphere Studio, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) designed specifically to make software robot development frictionless.
                    </p>
                    <p>Autosphere is an ever-growing collection of automation-related libraries to assist with automation efforts. Need to process Excel files? Need to interact with a browser or a desktop application? RPA Framework provides libraries for
                        many automation use cases. </p>

                    <h4 id="run">Run</h4>
                    <p>To <em>run</em> software robots, you have <strong>Orchestrator</strong>. Orchestrator provides centralized orchestration of software robots (what to run, where, and when) in selected environments
                        in a highly secure and scalable way.
