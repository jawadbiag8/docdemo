                            Welcome to Autosphere! This quickstart teaches you the basics of our products, how to build software robots in Autosphere Lab, and orchestrate them in our orchestrater. As we go through the process of software robot development.<br>Autosphere was founded on the realization that robotic process automation is fundamentally a developer domain. That's why we build our products with mainly developers in mind, but developers are people too! So our design approach is to use syntax and language that is easy to write and is easy to read.

                        <h4>Start building software robots today</h4>
                        <p class="m-b-15">After installing Autosphere, download ready-made robot Examples and open my-first-robot to learn how to develop your first software robot with Autosphere. You will learn the basic syntax of the robot, how to run it locally.<br>Example robots are a great way to get started with creating software robots. You can execute them with minimal setup. The robots use the recommended file structure.</p>
